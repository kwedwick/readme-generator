# README Generator

## Description

A fully customizable README.md node.js generator. Simply use “node index” in the Integrated Terminal and follow the on screen responses. Based on user input, sections will either be added or omitted. If you need more license or badge choices, you’ll need to add that into the “index.js” file.
