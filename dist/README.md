# React Portfolio

## Description

A simple portfolio using React with no backend. Custom made CSS styling to create project cards. At the moment, About Me and Resume sections need to be reworked to include a photo and informaiton - currently using LOREM to populate those pages. Using Hashrouter to allow pages to reload on refresh. Feel free to contribute to help display the resume on the "Resume tab"!

## Installation

You'll need to install React following their guidelines. The following technologies are used and will need to be imported: gh-pages-deploy, react-dom, react-external-link, react-pdf (currently not working), react-router-dom, and react strap (currently not utilized but maybe later on). 


## Usage
Run "npm i" to download the packages, you'll be able to add components and route them accordingly. the App.css is currently broken down separately into components rather than all media queiries at the bottom. Will need to adjust or change how the .css file is organized later on. Once you have adjusted and imported your information, you run "npm run deploy" and it'll create the build and push it to the github repo you have designated.
